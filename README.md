This is an assignment from The Odin Project "Foundations" curriculum. This project involves creating a mock landing page based off of a design provided by the creators of the course.
The design they have provided comes in the form of 2 images: one is an image of the complete website, and one has some details about some of the fonts and colors they have used.

In order to complete this task, I must effectively break down and understand the different components of the webpage and utilize HTML and CSS. The project consists of 4 main components and a footer. The Odin Project encourages us to create a more concrete webpage idea (as the project content itself is filler text and placeholder images). They also encourage us to experiment with the color scheme and fonts.

11/23/2021 - I wanted to make the project more personalized. I decided to create a webpage around the product of a course. The course is called "Hooman Purrfection", which is taught by cats for humans. Life can be very stressful for us, and oftentimes, I catch my cats taking their 11th nap for the day without a care in the world. I wanted to bridge the gap between my love for cats and creating a mock product/webpage.

11/28/2021 - Went with a dark and moody color palette. Cats are generally very tempermental and I thought the color scheme also fit in well with the course.

11/29/2021 - Found a font for the webpage's logo via Font Space.
