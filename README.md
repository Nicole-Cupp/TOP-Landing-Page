# TOP-Landing-Page

This is an assignment from The Odin Project "Foundations" curriculum. This project involves creating a mock landing page based off of a design provided by the creators of the course.
The design they have provided comes in the form of 2 images: one is an image of the complete website, and one has some details about some of the fonts and colors they have used.

In order to complete this task, I must effectively break down and understand the different components of the webpage and utilize HTML and CSS. The project consists of 4 main components and a footer. The Odin Project encourages us to create a more concrete webpage idea (as the project content itself is filler text and placeholder images). They also encourage us to experiment with the color scheme and fonts.
