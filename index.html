My cat, annoyed by the fact that my mood was ruining cuddle time, had told me about the Hooman Purrfection Course. At first, I was very skeptical, but I decided to give it a chance and enrolled. It completely changed my life! Now I can deal with stress like a champ. Whenever life gets me down,  I just go and take a nap wherever I am. It cheers me up every time.”</p>
